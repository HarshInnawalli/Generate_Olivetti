This is an implementation of a  variational autoencoder used to generate realistic Olivetti faces

The dataset used is the one from scikit: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces.html

Ensure that required libraries like torch torchvision matplotlib scikit-learn are downloaded

The generated faces are contained in the images.jpg file
